Hello,
As you already know that the situations have changed now and because of that you should not be sending me the messages unless it's really urgent and important.

I fully understand that you are concerned about Noah, but you should be respecting the agreement towards Noah and hence reach out only when it's extremely urgent.

Noah is doing good. I am using the same agency that I used before to get the export certificate. I will try to share the certificate with you on 11th or 12th June. I will go to ACQS once along with agent to get the microchip checked and I will be careful in handling it.

I will reach out to you if there will be any change in the existing plan or there is any emergency.
